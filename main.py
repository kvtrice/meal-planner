# Start a new Meal Plan

# Ask user for calories
# User enters cals
# Determine what range that calorie goal is in
user1 = user_plan.User()
print(user1)

# Based on the calorie goal, determine what calories can be in each type of meal

# create a day object, pass it the calorie goal + range from the User




# Once we have a calorie range for each meal type, we need to find a random meal for each

# Breakfast = 1 meal
# Lunch = 1 meal
# Dinner = 1 meal
# Snacks = 2 

# Once each meal is grabbed, append it to a list on the Day Class - this is their daily meal plan
# Add that day to a list on the User - this will become their weekly meal plan

# Once all meals are grabbed, sum the total calories for the day, based on the meals in the list
# Check that sum against what the user entered as their target.
# Is the sum within 100 cals either side? If yes - print
# If not, try again

# Once successful meal plan is arrived it, print it to the user

# Check with the usre if they're happy with it
# If no, they can re-roll it
# If yes, print to a file
